# Java Practice Projects! 

This repository contains small Java programs ane exercises that I am building as I learn Java from the ground up (covering basic syntax to object-oriented programming). 
The main goal of this repo is to track my growth and to practice Java fundamentals.
I am also using this repo to improve my Git/GitHub workflow: pushing code, version control, commit history.

### controlflow 
- Java Syntax basics
